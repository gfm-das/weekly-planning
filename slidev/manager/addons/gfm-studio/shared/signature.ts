 * A grid of twelve `<Mascot />` elements is twelve tags with the same name. If

 * stale line hint would happily verify against the wrong one and the editor
 * would write to a different element than the user clicked. Hashing the tag as
 * written makes that impossible without carrying the whole tag into the DOM.

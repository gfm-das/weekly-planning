 * The first is the block itself: it is made editable in place, so what you type
 * is set in the deck's own font, at its own size, in its own colour, wrapping
 * where it will really wrap. Nothing is simulated, because it is the slide.
 *
 * What comes back has to be Markdown again, and that is the risk in every
 * visual editor: round-tripping rendered HTML is where components, directives
 * and formatting go missing. So the block is only offered visually when its
 * markup can be written back exactly, which `md/inline.ts` decides by refusing
 * everything it does not recognise. A table, a fenced code block, a component,
 * a styled span: those open the second way, the block's Markdown as text, which
 * can express anything and never loses what it did not understand.

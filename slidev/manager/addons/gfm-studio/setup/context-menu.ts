/**
 * Right-click on the canvas.
 *
 * Slidev already puts navigation, drawing and presenter mode there, and a
 * canvas editor is exactly the kind of tool where the menu is expected to know
 * what you are pointing at. So the block's own actions come first when
 * something is selected, and Slidev's own follow.
 *
 * Nothing here is new behaviour: every item calls the same function the Element
 * panel calls, so the menu cannot drift away from the panel.
 *
 * Studio is an authoring tool, and a built deck is not being authored. Slidev
 * gates the panel and the toolbar button on `__DEV__` already; the menu has to
 * gate itself, or a published deck offers to open an editor that was never
 * bundled with it.
